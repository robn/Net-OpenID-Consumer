    * we now do actual checking of responce_nonce (closes #44767)

    * lots of POD fixes

1.100099_001 Oct 25 2011

  ---------------
  ==> API CHANGE:  Consumer->args(CODEREF)

      CODEREF now needs to be able to also take zero arguments and
      return a list of all URL parameters in the request.

      No change is needed for the other argument types
      (i.e., unblessed hash or CGI/Apache/etc request object)

      (Enumeration is required for check_authentication in OpenID 2.0
      to work properly -- if the list isn't available then we can revert
      to OpenID 1.1 behavior of only sending the signed parameters and
      hope for the best, but be warned that some providers may reject
      this.)

  ---------------

    * HTML parsing routines now reside in Net::OpenID::Common (1.12
      required) which has itself been upgraded to using HTML::Parser.

1.030099_006 Oct 22 2011

  ---------------
  ==> API CHANGE:  Consumer->handle_server_response()

      The 'setup_required' callback is now DEPRECATED but still
      recognized for now for the sake of legacy code.  It may be
      removed in a future release.

      Use 'setup_needed' instead.  This callback
        (1) is invoked in ALL cases where a checkid_immediate mode
            request fails, including those where user_setup_url
            is not supplied, and
        (2) is NOT supplied a user_setup_url parameter
            (you can still use Consumer->user_setup_url as needed)

      Note that in OpenID 2.0, the correct way to handle failure of a
      checkid_immediate mode request is to retry the same request
      again in checkid_setup mode.  user_setup_url is generally not
      meaningful in OpenID 2.0 and therefore CANNOT be relied upon.

  ---------------
  ==> API CHANGE:  Consumer->setup_needed()  [new function]

      Should be used to test for the failed checkid_immediate case
      when not using handle_server_response().

      Testing for user_setup_url() having been set is DEPRECATED and
      will NOT work under OpenID 2.0 since user_setup_url is generally
      not meaningful in 2.0 (even if some 2.0 providers do in fact
      supply it).

  ---------------

    * Handle 2.0 provider-specific 'error' mode responses.
      These currently show up in the 'error' callback 
      (errcode == 'provider_error');

    * Remove dependency in ordering of minimum_version() and args()
      setters.  This was a bug that prevented minimum_version from being
      recognized at all.

    * Fix handle_server_response unknown callback error message -- close #58368

    * Handle version 2.0 associations and all session/association types.
      This is customizable using Consumer->assoc_options.

    * Fix bug in handling of sreg extension under 2.0
      that prevented certain other extensions from being recognized.

    * New co-maintainer (Roger Crew)

1.030099_005 Jan 01 2011

    * Remove calls to util::ejs and util::eurl; use JSON and URI::Escape
      directly (Robert Norris)

1.030099_004 Dec 18 2010

    * Added example CGI program (Robert Norris)

    * Added missing error messages (Mario Domgoergen)

1.030099_003 Nov 09 2010

    * Add namespace to check_authentication signature verification calls to
      fix stateless mode against strict OPs (Robert Norris)

    * Documentation tweaks (Robert Norris)

1.030099_002 Nov 07 2010

    * Fixed a call to OpenID::util::hmac_sha1_hex which no longer exists
      (Robert Norris)

1.030099_001 Nov 06 2010

    * Use Crypt::DH::GMP over Crypt::DH for speed (Robert Norris)

    * Fix potential timing attack when checking signatures (Adam Sjøgren)
      (see http://lists.openid.net/pipermail/openid-security/2010-July/001156.html)

        * Set sreg namespace based on what the server is expecting
      (Adam Sjøgren)

        * Moved some utility bits out to a separate Net::OpenID::Common
          package so that Net::OpenID::Server can use it in future
          versions.

1.03:

        * Enforce the rules from the Auth 2.0 spec about which fields
          MUST be signed in positive assertion messages.

        * Return a more sensible error (no_head_tag) if the identifier
          URL returns an empty (0-byte) HTML document.

        * Verify delegate on the non-fragment version of the resulting
          identifier, so that you can delegate to providers that add
          fragments to their identifiers.
          Found and fixed by avarix <mindsectr@gmail.com>.

1.02:

        * Declare dependency on XML::Simple

1.01:

        * Make the verified_identity bit accept assertions from any
          declared endpoint, rather than only the primary one.
          This implementation kinda sucks because it hits the identity
          URL over and over doing discovery.

        * Refactor the discovery code a little so that the whole list
          of valid endpoints can optionally be returned. This is in
          preparation for fixing the assertion verification code
          so that providers other than the primary one are able to
          make assertions.

        * Support indirect messages encapsualated in POST requests
          when args are given as a CGI, Apache, or Apache::Request
          object.

        * Support the 1.1 and 1.0 namespace values required by
          Auth 2.0 section 4.1.2.

        * Deal with cases where Net::OpenID::Yadis returns arrayref
          or hashref for Service->URI, including a basic support for
          the priority attribute. Based on a patch from
          Fumiaki Yoshimatsu <fyoshimatsu@sixapart.com>.

        * when dealing with a 2.0 server, send 2.0-shaped association
          requests.

        * add the set_extension_args method to ClaimedIdentity and the
          extension_fields and signed_extension_fields methods to
          VerifiedIdentity, which together form a higher-level API
          for using protocol extensions such as SREG and PAPE.

        * add support for OpenID 2.0-style messages from providers

        * use our own simplified fork of Net::Yadis::Discovery to avoid
          dependency on Module::Pluggable::Fast. Or on Net::Yadis::Discovery,
          for that matter.

        * add hooks for openid-test project. (bradfitz)

        * add OpenID 2.0-compliant discovery and authentication request.

        * add method on claimed identity object to get delgated URL

0.14: (2007-08-03)

        * allow CGI subclasses (like CGI::Fast) for args.  bug fix
          from Chris Kastorff <encryptio@gmail.com>.

0.13:
        * work-around bug in some openid servers that don't escape "+".
          so treat a space as a +.  (from Thomas Sibley
          <trs@bestpractical.com>)

        * go into dumb mode earlier if it's detected that our cache object
          isn't working

        * give callers access to the signed_fields from the verified
          identity object

0.12:
        * required_root in constructor/method/validated_identity

        * allow https identities

        * version 1.1 of the protocol

        * expand entities in link rel

        * reject cached association validation if expiry is in past

0.11:
        * document common error codes from claimed_identity, and
          cleanup some error handling/codes

        * support openid.mode=cancel

        * respect replace_after and expiry.  do clock compensation
          between local clock and server.

        * invalidate_handle support

0.10:
        * handle openid.delegate properly (was losing state because I'd
          put a URL parameter onto the wrong URL)

        * copy all signed parameters into POST args in dumb mode,
          not a static set (to be future-proof)

0.09:
        * switch to DH/HMAC protocol, not DSA protocol

0.08:
        * more openssl-binary temp file changes.  on second failure (which
          was previously missing a new method), it also propogates up the
          error message now, instead of dying, to be more consistent with
          the other DSA checkers, which never die

0.07:
        * bugfix: use URI::Fetch 0.02, not "0.02" in quotes

        * bugfix: don't set cache if no cache

0.06:
        * wrap Crypt::OpenSSL::DSA verify in eval {} as it can croak

        * use URI::Fetch, which does caching and proper HTTP behavior

        * let user get/set cache, which is then propogated down to URI::Fetch

        * optionally use new pure-perl version of Crypt::DSA which now
          does ASN.1 serialization/deserialization in both signatures and
          public keys.  brings total options of DSA verify techniques up
          to 3.

        * tmpdir option (and smart auto-configuration) for people using
          OpenSSL binaries to verify signatures.

        * security fix when doing DSA checks with system openssl binary
          (was previously parsing the wrong status)

        * misc reported bugfixes

0.05:
        * stupid push_url_arg bugfix

        * doc fix in example code (no post_grant in check_url)

0.04:
        * tons more docs:  in both ClaimedIdentity and VerifiedIdentity

        * Consumer now observes atom/rss/foaf/foafmaker at the same time
          as openid.server, and passes it along to VerifiedIdentity,
          where it's accessible, and VerifiedIdentity knows whether or
          not those urls are under the trusted one or not, and makes them
          differently available to callers

        * bug fixes, doc fixes

        * post_grant moved to user_setup_url, not check_url

        * delayed_return added to check_url

0.03:
        * setting args in constructor was broken

        * renamed get_claimed_identity to just claimed_identity to be
          consistent

        * all methods now croak if called with too many arguments

        * added ClaimedIdentity->identity_server to get just one,
          as selected by plugin, instead of array of them all

0.02:
        * POD docs for Net/OpenID/Consumer.pm

        * accepts CGI, Apache, Apache::Request, and CODE arguments now for
        GET argument retrievers, in addition to just HASH references

        * openid.server auto-discovery only happens within first <head> tag

        * if using Crypt::OpenSSL::DSA, now requires 0.12 due to bugs found
          in 0.11.

        * DSA verification using OpenSSL binary no longer spews "Verification OK"
          to stdout

0.01:
        * fetching of page (with configurable user agent object; I
          recommend you use LWPx::ParanoidAgent, now available on CPAN)
          and returning a "ClaimedIdentity" object of what the user claims
          they are, but is not verified yet

        * auto-discovery of openid servers

        * hook to let you provide your subref to do openid server
          selection, given multiple options

        * generation of "check" URL to send user to to get redirect

        * reading of response parameters, returning either a
          user_setup_url or a VerifiedIdentity object (doing DSA
          validation with either Crypt::OpenSSL::DSA or your openssl
          binary)

         * start of JSON responses for javascript UI
