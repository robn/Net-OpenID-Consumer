You will want to obtain and install the most recent
version of Net-OpenID-Common if you have not done so already.

If you downloaded this package off of CPAN,
it should build and install in the standard way:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If you are building this package directly from a git repository,
you will most likely need to install Dist::Zilla first.  See

    http://dzil.org/
